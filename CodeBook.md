Codebook for run_analysis.R  (c) William W. Kennerly, February 2015

The data was collected from data espionage specialist, Jeff Leek, from Samsung.  It contains several files and subdirectories with readmes, codebooks, and multiple datasets, and text variable names in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"  None of these items were altered.

My script run_analysis.R merges the training and testing data sets "X_train.txt", and "X_test.txt" (resp) and properly combines them with the subject numbers and activity names which were provided in separate files in the UCI HAR Dataset directory.  The subject and activity names were converted to factor variables.  The activity names were converted to plain-English names.

Then only the data that represented either the mean or standard deviation were kept, which specifically was implemented by keeping only those variables from the Samsung sets whose names included the strings "mean" or "std".    This left 79 variables (not including subject number or activity)

Then the script blocks the data by subject and activity type to compute the mean of each of the remaining 79 variables by block.  This summary data is then saved.

DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLES
---
"subject" --- an integer from 1 to 30 which codes which individual was the subject for the collected data in this line
"activity" --- a factor in plain English of six possible values indicated the activity the subject was participating in at the time the data was collected

The following 79 variables are the means of those quantities provided in the original Samsung data set.  The names are the same as provided by Samsung.  Who the hell knows what they mean.  They are all unitless (having come from normalized data) and the original data was all in the range -1 to 1.
