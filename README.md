# SamsungDataCleaning  (c) William W. Kennerly
R Script created to clean the Samsung data set for the Data Cleaning course on Coursera (Feb 2015). 

run_analysis.R: for use on a specific data set of Samsung cell phone accelerometer data.  

It merges various files from the set into one large set, looks at the variables that represent means and standard deviations, and computes the mean of those values as a function of user and the user's activity while collecting the data.  More detail can be found in CodeBook.md

The original data was collected from corporate espionage specialist, Jeff Leek, from Samsung.  It contains several files and subdirectories with readmes, codebooks, and multiple datasets, and text variable names in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"  None of these items were altered.

THE SCRIPT CAN BE RUN FROM ANYWHERE ON YOUR SYSTEM'S FILE DIRECTORY.  
HOWEVER: The first line of the script will need to be modified to the specific location of the UCI HAR Dataset directory on your machine.

If you do not have this data set then this script will not be of much use to you.  I suggest wiring Jeff Leek large amounts of currency.  Espionage is expensive.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
